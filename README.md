# I'm Vivian!

I am a [public relations account executive](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivianthaonguyen/) residing in beautiful San Diego. The main reason I am pushing myself to learn about GitHub is because I work in the tech space. I am lucky to get to collaborate with incredible and innovative changemakers from brand new startups to industry heavyweights.

Thank you for reading about my project!
